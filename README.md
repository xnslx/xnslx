### Updates: Newly launched headless e-commerce website, <a href="https://naixjewelry.vercel.app/">link</a>

My name is Xian. I am a full-time mom with two little kiddos, who are 5.5 yrs and 7.5 yrs old. 

We used to live in Kansas, a Midwestern state in USA, in which is famous for the film The Wizard of Oz, which took place against the backdrop of Kansas, then move to Los Alamsos which is located in NM. 

I studies English Literature and took my Master degree in UK in Sheffield University majoring in global journalism. I was a recipient of ERASMUS funding and I was also an intern in WHO Headquarter for three month. I like Switzerland, it is beautiful. 

I have been self learning UI/UX design and web development for a couple of years. 

I am a JavaScript-based full-stack developer. My main technical stacks are React and NextJs. I am using Nodejs for setting up the backend and if database is needed, I am using MongoDB or Graphql. 

For the UI/ UX, the main tool is AdobeXD for sketching, wire framing, designing, and prototyping. This is my <a href="https://www.behance.net/xnslx89fc36">Behance</a>. 

My current interest lies in building headless e-commerce websites. I am using SanityIo as CMS. Before Shopify released Hydrogen, a React-based framework, I use NextJs combining with SanityIo to build websites. Now I am playing a lot with Hydrogen, I have already built a demo one, <a href="https://dry-tundra-02789.herokuapp.com/">Wooden Garden</a>.

My very recent side work is a very small <a href="https://sanity-nextjs-landing-pages-with-two-axios-carousel.netlify.app">demo website</a> that I built. I came across Zara's website the other day. I was fascinated by the two axios carousel that users can swipe carousel horizontally while for each carousel, you can swipe the slide up and down vertically. I mock a similar one. Still using SanityIo to store data. 

Right now I put most of my energy in marketing jewelry store, <a href="https://naix.vercel.app/">Naix</a>. I am the solo marketer, UI designer and developer and I love designing, building and bringing it to life. With six month of marketing, the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/naixjewelrystore/_shop/">Pinterest</a> has already reached 150k monthly views.

My name Xian. I am a full-time mom with two little kiddos, who are 3.5 yrs and 5.5 yrs old. 

Me, my husband and our two little ones are living in Kansas, a Midwestern state in USA, in which is famous for the film The Wizard of Oz, it took place against the backdrop of Kansas. 

I studies English Literature and took my Master degree in UK in Sheffield University majoring in global journalism. I was a recipient of ERASMUS funding and I was also an intern in WHO Headquarter for three month. I like Switzerland, it is beautiful. 

I have been self learning UI/UX design and web development for a couple of years. 

I am a JavaScript-based full-stack developer. My main technical stacks are React and NextJs. I am using Nodejs for setting up the backend and if database is needed, I am using MongoDB or Graphql. 

For the UI/ UX, the main tool is AdobeXD for sketching, wire framing, designing, and prototyping. This is my <a href="https://www.behance.net/xnslx89fc36">Behance</a>. 

My current interest lies in building headless e-commerce websites. I am using SanityIo as CMS. Before Shopify released Hydrogen, a React-based framework, I use NextJs combining with SanityIo to build websites. Now I am playing a lot with Hydrogen, I have already built a demo one, <a href="https://dry-tundra-02789.herokuapp.com/">Wooden Garden</a>.

Right now I put most of my energy in marketing jewelry store, <a href="https://www.naix.shop/">Naix</a>. I am the solo marketer, UI designer and developer and I love designing, building and bringing it to life. With six month of marketing, the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/naixjewelrystore/_shop/">Pinterest</a> has already reached 150k monthly views.
